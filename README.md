# Social_Distancing_detector_ai

Social Distancing, also known as "physical distancing", means keeping a safe distance(at least 6 ft.) between youself and other people who are not from your 
household in both indoor and outdoor.

The objective is to reduce transmission, reducing the size of the epidemic peak, and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system.

Social distancing aims to decrease or interrupt transmission of COVID-19 in a population by minimizing contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy 
individuals, or between population groups with high rates of transmission and population groups with no or low levels of transmission.

In this project, we have created a Social Distance detection system to detect the number of violations within a specific area. Although this system is made with the 
most of the resources available, sometimes it tends to give wrong assumptions based on the video it has captured. The project has been created using Python, a very well-known and easy to use language for these purposes. In addition to these, we have made use of the numpy, pandas, opencv-python, imutils and scipy used as the major packages for the system. The system makes use of a GPU for processing the frames of the video for faster and reliable processing. The main drawback in this system is that it cannot be totally relied on because the video which the camera captures comes in the form of 2-D frames, from where the actual distance(6 ft.) cannot be measured in anyway with the available resources. Whereas, this could be made possible with multiple views of the same frame or a drone-view of the area.
